Riddhi,

It looks like you started off with some admirably high ambitions, but then got
stuck trying to figure out how to use yfinance. For what it's worth, both of
those hazards are pretty normal. Software engineers routinely bit off more than
they can chew. And in my experience, dealing with software you didn't write
always takes more time than the parts you write yourself.

Still, that leaves me with not much code to base a grade on. It's not too late
to finish the project! I do take a little bit off for late submissions, but
that's still way better than nothing!
